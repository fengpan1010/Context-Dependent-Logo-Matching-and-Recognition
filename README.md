# Context-Dependent-Logo-Matching-and-Recognition
The objective of this project is to design a novel variational framework which is able to match and recognize multiple instances of multiple reference logos in image archives. Reference logos and test images are seen as constellations of local features (interest points, regions, etc.) and matched by minimizing an energy function mixing: 1) a fidelity term that measures the quality of feature matching, 2) a neighbourhood criterion that captures feature co-occurrence/geometry, and 3) a regularization term that controls the smoothness of the matching solution. We also introduce a detection/recognition procedure and study its theoretical consistency. Finally, we show the validity of our method through extensive experiments on the challenging MICC-Logos dataset. Our method overtakes, by 20%, baseline as well as state-of-the-art matching/recognition procedures.
